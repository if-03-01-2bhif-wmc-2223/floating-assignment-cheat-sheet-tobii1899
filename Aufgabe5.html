        In general, JPEG is a good choice for photographs because it supports lossy compression, which allows for smaller file sizes without significantly degrading the quality of the image.<br>
        GIF is a good choice for graphics with a limited number of colors, such as logos or icons, because it supports lossless compression.<br>
        PNG is a good choice for graphics that require transparency, such as logos with a transparent background.<br>
        ICO is a good choice for icons because it is a specialized format for icons. SVG is a good choice for graphics that need to be scaled, such as logos, because it is a scalable vector graphic format.<br>
        MPEG and MP4 are good choices for motion pictures because they support video.<br>
